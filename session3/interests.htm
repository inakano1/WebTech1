    <p>My top three interests are <a href="#anchor1">crypto</a>, <a href="#anchor2">sports</a>, and <a href="#anchor3">travelling</a>.</p>
    
    <h2 id="anchor1">Cryptocurrency</h2>
    <p>I started trading and investing into cryptocurrency earlier this year, and was drawn by the potential of the blockchain technology.</p>
    <h2 id="anchor2">Sports</h2>
    <p>I have been playing different types of sports since I was young, and I enjoy watching as well.</p>
    <h2 id="anchor3">Travelling</h2>
    <p>Whenever I have free time outside of school, I enjoy travelling to different places around the world.</p>
